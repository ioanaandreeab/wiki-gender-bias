Renowned artist Tone (仲維軍) formed this band after releasing his first album titled "我的6:57am" (My 6:57 AM), and recruited two other members to form Cool Silly.

The song attracted many fans, which led to Cool Silly's debut in 2010 with the release of their first digital album, Cool Silly: The Prelude. Since their debut, they have often been compared with the Popular Taiwanese rock group F.I.R. because of the similar formation of band members and attractive performance personalities.

The resulting tune, “Light Up Your Dreams”, was later distributed as an EP single in Apple Weekly Magazine and promoted on various internet channels. The name Cool Silly comes from the band's ideology that "a person can't be cool unless they're silly as well". The band insists that the personality of their music is not only "cool," but at the same time "silly."

Deborah Vernon Buller Murphy (née Drake-Brockman, previously Hackett and Moulden; 18 June 1887 – 16 April 1965), best known as Lady Hackett or Lady Moulden, was an Australian community worker, philanthropist, and mining investor. Born in West Guildford, Western Australia, on 18 June 1887, she was the daughter of surveyor Frederick Slade Drake-Brockman and heroine Grace Vernon Bussell and younger sister of Edmund Drake-Brockman. On 3 August 1905, at the age of 18, she married (Sir) John Winthrop Hackett (1848-1916), who was forty years her senior. He was a newspaper proprietor, newspaper editor, and prominent Western Australian politician. They had a son, also named John Winthrop Hackett (later General Sir John Hackett (1910-1997) commander-in-chief of the British Army on the Rhine before becoming principal of King's College London upon retirement), and four daughters. Hackett senior died in 1916 leaving a large estate to his family, and a large endowment to the University of Western Australia. On 10 April 1918 Lady Hackett, now aged 30, married (Sir) Frank Beaumont Moulden and moved to Adelaide; she was Lady Mayoress of Adelaide 1919–1921, and became Lady Moulden in 1922. Moulden died after a cerebral haemorrhage on 8 April 1932. "Having no children, he helped to raise his wife's five and the three of his late brother". In 1923 Lady Moulden became interested in tantalite, a rare mineral found in the Northern Territory and at Wodgina in Western Australia. Tantalite was scarce throughout the world, and the price of tantalum was enormous; she saw the wealth that it could bring to Australia, particularly if it was processed in Australia, but the government was not particularly interested in the idea. She founded Tantalite Ltd which was incorporated in 1932. In World War II her tantalum was used in developing radar; the need for it became so obvious to the previously reluctant Commonwealth government that it resumed Tantalite Ltd for the duration of the war. In 1932, the University of Western Australia conferred upon her an honorary Doctorate of Laws. The degree was awarded in absentia due to the recent death of Sir Frank Moulden. On 27 June 1936 she married Basil Buller Murphy, a barrister nine years her junior; she became known as Dr Buller Murphy. He died 10 March 1963. She died at her home, Lordello, (in Kilsyth, Victoria) on 16 April 1965 and was buried in Karrakatta cemetery, Perth.

Esther Hellman Wallenstein (November 1846 – July 8, 1903) was the founding president of the Hebrew Infant Asylum, an orphanage in New York City. Born in Bavaria, Germany, in 1846, she emigrated to the United States around 1862 and married Solomon Wallenstein (1831 – July 30, 1905), a tobacconist, in 1865. They had four children: Jennie Wallenstein Kohnstamm (August 21, 1866 – October 26, 1954); Joseph Solomon Wallenstein (December 15, 1869 – May 1, 1928); Max W. Wallenstein (December 15, 1867 – February 8, 1952); and Milton H. Wallenstein (June 30, 1876 – July 2, 1948). As a member of the Hebrew Sheltering Guarding Society and a guide of the Ahavath Chesed Sisterhood of Personal Service, Wallenstein had been approached for help by parents of infants for years. She enlisted the help of the United Hebrew Charities and many wealthy Jewish New Yorkers. On October 25, 1892, Wallenstein and others formed a "committee on permanent organization". Two weeks later, the Hebrew Infant Asylum was organized, with Wallenstein as president. The original objective of the asylum – which began with 250 members – was "to receive and take charge of infants in cases where parent or parents are dead or unable or incompetent to afford to the infant the nursing and attention which they merit, and to care for their religious, physical and moral training." After a reorganization and some well placed political intervention, the Asylum was finally granted a charter on April 17, 1895. Within only a few years of its founding, the board of directors of the Asylum could count among its membership Lyman G. Bloomingdale (1841–1905), a co-founder of Bloomingdale’s department store and Isidor Straus (February 6, 1845 – April 15, 1912), a co-owner of Macy's department store. On May 26, 1895, the Hebrew Infant Asylum was dedicated at well attended ceremony at its new home on Mott Avenue and 149th Street in the Bronx (today the site of Hostos Community College). Wallenstein gave welcoming remarks in her original German, where she declared "the Hebrew Infant Asylum of the City of New York formally opened for the reception of those unfortunate little creatures to whom that blessing has been denied, to call the sweet names, 'Papa—Mama'; but we will endeavor to take the place of parents for those innocent infants with the aid of our Heavenly Father." She was presented with a portrait of herself by the board, which was thereafter hung in the new Asylum. Wallenstein ran the Hebrew Infant Asylum for the next eight years, until her sudden death at the age of 57 on July 8, 1903. She is buried in Beth El Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens along with Solomon, their four children and their spouses – and two grandchildren. In the years that followed, Wallenstein's children stayed active in the Hebrew Infant Asylum (Joseph and Jennie remained on the board. Joseph ran the Young Folks League for Aid to Hebrew Infants, an arm of the Asylum). The Asylum moved to a new location at University Avenue and Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx in 1898. By 1942 it merged with the Jewish Child Care Association. The records of the Asylum are now housed at the American Jewish Historical Society in New York City. One of Wallenstein's grandchildren, Herbert J. Wallenstein (August 1, 1917 – February 18, 1996) went on to become an Assistant Attorney General and the Bureau Chief of the Charity Frauds Bureau under New York State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz (July 3, 1904 – June 20, 1996). He was also a candidate for New York State Assembly and Municipal Court Judge in Manhattan.

Harriet Lawrence Hemenway (1858–1960) was a Boston socialite who cofounded the Massachusetts Audubon Society with Minna B. Hall. Hemenway was the wife of Augustus Hemenway. During the Gilded Age, it became fashionable for women to wear hats decorated with plumes. These plumes came from woodpeckers, bluebirds, owls, herons and warblers, thousands of which were killed each year. In 1896, Hemenway and her cousin Minna B. Hall held tea parties for the wealthy women of Boston where they urged them not to wear feathered hats and invited them to join a society for the protection of birds. Having gained the support of many of these fashionable women, Hemenway and Hall then organized meetings between leaders of the high society and prominent New England ornithologists, paving the way for the creation of the Massachusetts Audubon Society; over 900 women joined. Hemenway and Hall recruited William Brewster, a leading ornithologist, to be the Massachusetts Audubon Society's first president. Women played a critical role in the organization, counting for half of its officers and serving as leaders of most of the local chapters. The group used its political power to have a Massachusetts law passed in 1897 outlawing trade in wild bird feathers as well as a federal law, the 1900 Lacey Act, which prohibits the interstate shipment of animals killed in violation of local laws. The Massachusetts Audubon Society remains independent, but it helped to organize the National Association of Audubon Societies (incorporated in 1905), which later became the National Audubon Society. Hemenway was not a stranger to controversy and came from a family of abolitionists. She once invited Booker T. Washington to stay in her home, when Boston hotels refused to let him a room. In 1898, Hemenway donated $50,000 for the construction of the gymnasium at Radcliffe College. Her home is a stop on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. Hemenway Street was named in her honor. It runs between Boylston Street and Huntington Avenue in Boston's Fenway neighborhood.

Josephine Dickinson (born 9 January 1957) is an English poet. When Dickinson was eighteen months old, she contracted meningitis and was hospitalized for two weeks during the acute phase; she lost her hearing after age six. She resides in a remote area of the Pennines, and raises a small flock of sheep along with writing poetry. In her volume of poetry entitled Silence Fell, which became a New York Times editor's choice book in 2007, she wrote about her six-year marriage to her husband, which began when she was 41 and he was in his late 80s. Reviewer James Longenbach in the New York Times described her poetry as not showy, with delicate near-rhymes which feel "inevitable" and that her subject matter showed an "acute relationship to the physical sensation of language" which "distinguishes these humble, deftly made poems." Chicago Tribune reviewer Katie Peterson wrote that Dickinson's poems were about "sheep farming and love" and that she is "at her best when she addresses love directly" with sometimes "complicated conclusions about sex and intimacy" and her "frank ability to bear pleasure and difficulty together". Critic Phoebe Pettingell calls Dickinson's early work "underwritten," but praised Silence Fell as, "emotionally engaging," expressing the hope that Dickinson would "develop from a pleasant, provincial poet to a rich and strange singer of the rural scene." Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, poet Amy Newman described Dickinson as having "a talent for conveying the inaudible, the aura around us that can't be heard but can be felt."

Judith A. Curry is an American climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Her research interests include hurricanes, remote sensing, atmospheric modeling, polar climates, air-sea interactions, climate models, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for atmospheric research. She was a member of the National Research Council's Climate Research Committee, published over a hundred scientific papers, and co-edited several major works. Curry retired from academia in 2017 at age 63. Curry has become known as a contrarian scientist hosting a blog which is part of the climate change denial blogosphere. Social scientists who have studied Curry's position on climate change have described it as "neo-skepticism", in that her current position includes certain features of denialism: On the one hand, she accepts that the planet is warming, that human-generated greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide cause warming, and that the plausible worst-case scenario is potentially catastrophic, but on the other hand, she also proposes that the rate of warming is slower than climate models have projected, emphasizes her evaluation of the uncertainty in the climate prediction models, and questions whether climate change mitigation is affordable. Despite the broad consensus among climate scientists that climate change requires urgent action, Curry has testified to the United States Congress that, in her opinion, there is so much uncertainty about natural climate variation that trying to reduce emissions may be pointless.

Khuit I was an Egyptian queen who lived in the mid-5th Dynasty of Egypt. She was buried in mastaba D 14 at Saqqara. The Austrian Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has suggested that was the queen of pharaoh Menkauhor Kaiu. Based on the datation of the tombs surrounding Khuit's burial, Seipel argues that she lived during the mid-Fifth Dynasty. Proceeding by elimination, Seipel attributed known queens to each king of the period, which only leaves Menkauhor as a candidate king for her. These arguments are criticized by the French Egyptologist Michel Baud, who observes that pharaohs could have had more than one queen. Another queen by the name of Meresankh IV is more commonly suggested as the wife of Menkauhor Kaiu and thus may have been a contemporary of Khuit. Khuit held the titles Great one of the hetes-sceptre (wrt-hetes), She who sees Horus and Seth (m33t-hrw-stsh), Great of Praises, King’s Wife, his beloved, Attendant of the Great One, King’s Daughter, and King’s Wife.

Margaret Anne Hickey (born 16 October 1946) is a former Australian politician. She represented the electoral division of Barkly for the Labor Party in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1990 to 2001. She was Leader of the Opposition from 1996 to 1999. Hickey was born in Surrey, England and emigrated to Australia with her husband in 1975. She was a librarian prior to entering politics. In the 1980s, Hickey was a strident campaigner against a proposed toxic waste incinerator in Tennant Creek that was supported by local MLA and Chief Minister Ian Tuxworth from 1984 onwards. She was a member of the Labor Party up until her resignation about six months before the 1987 election, having become disillusioned with a number of stances of the local party branch. At the 1987 election, she challenged Tuxworth, who by this stage had been ousted as Chief Minister and left the governing Country Liberal Party for the rival Northern Territory Nationals, as an independent candidate. She was defeated by only nineteen votes, and overturned the result in the Court of Disputed Returns, which found that the Labor candidate had been unqualified to stand. Hickey contested the ensuing by-election as the Labor candidate, but was again defeated by Tuxworth. She contested Barkly again at the 1990 election. A redistribution ahead of that election made Barkly notionally Labor. Tuxworth believed this made Barkly unwinnable, and unsuccessfully tried to switch to the seat of Goyder. This allowed Hickey to take the seat on a large swing. On 16 April 1996, Opposition Leader Brian Ede resigned as territory Labor leader, and Hickey, who had been Ede's deputy, was elected the new leader. Her term as leader saw her deal with Labor's response to the government's controversial mandatory sentencing laws, largely cited as a factor in the CLP's landslide win at the 1997 election, disputes over native title, and the 1998 statehood referendum. In August 1998, she defeated a leadership challenge by Syd Stirling with a margin of six votes to one. She ardently opposed federal Labor's restrictions on expanding uranium mining, condemning both the "three mines" and "no new mines" policies. On 2 February 1999, Hickey announced that she was resigning as Labor leader and Opposition Leader in order to spend more time with her husband who had been diagnosed with a brain tumour. She stated that she would remain as the member for Barkly in the Assembly until the next election, and Clare Martin was elected to succeed her as party leader the next day. Asked about her resignation in 2002, following her successor Martin's landmark 2001 election victory, Hickey stated that she had no regrets about the decision. After retiring from parliament in 2001, Hickey moved to Adelaide, where she studied visual arts at the University of South Australia.

Marie-Thérèse Reboul (26 February 1738—4 January 1806), commonly called Madame Vien, was a French painter and engraver of natural history subjects, still lifes, and flowers. In 1757, Marie-Thérèse Reboul married the painter Joseph-Marie Vien, who was 22 years older. Nineteenth-century sources state that she was taught by her husband, but Joseph-Marie Vien's autobiography does not mention it. She may have been a student of Madeleine Françoise Basseporte. Prior to her marriage, Madame Vien engraved specimens for Sénégal: Coquillages (1757) by the French naturalist Michel Adanson and Dissertation sur le papyrus (1758) by the French antiquarian Anne Claude de Caylus. Madame Vien was one of only fifteen women to be accepted as full academicians in the 145-year history of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris. She was admitted in 1757, the same year in which she married Joseph-Marie Vien. It had been 37 years since the last woman, Rosalba Carriera, became an academician. Madame Vien's husband was a prominent member of the Académie, which likely led to her acceptance. At the time, Madame Vien was described as "a painter of miniatures and gouaches specializing in flowers, butterflies and birds." Her reception piece was Two Pigeons Pigeons on a Tree Branch, which she submitted to the Académie in 1762. She exhibited her works at the Salons of 1757, 1759, 1763, 1765, and 1767. These included watercolors of a hen with her chicks, a kestrel killing a small bird, a golden pheasant from China, a brooding pigeon, and a bird of prey following a butterfly. At the Salon of 1767, Denis Diderot praised A Crested Hen Watching over Her Chicks as a "very handsome small painting" that was "painted with great vigor and coloristic truth ... Everything's right, including the bits of straw scattered around the hen." He concluded, more critically, "I'm surprised by her hen; I didn't think she was this accomplished." Several of Madame Vien's works were acquired by Catherine the Great. By the late the nineteenth century, few of her watercolors could be located.

Marina Pierro (born 9 October 1956, or 1960) is an Italian actress, model, writer, and film director, who is best known for her artistic relationship with Polish filmmaker Walerian Borowczyk (1923-2006). Pierro and Borowczyk's collaboration lasted approximately ten years and comprised five completed films and one foray into episodic television. Pierro has been described as an "erotic icon of auteur cinema" and she has referred to herself as Walerian Borowczyk's muse. Michael Brooke, a writer specializing in European cinema and an enthusiast of Borowczyk's films, has suggested the importance of Pierro in evaluating the director's work: It's hard to ignore, not least because it's a matter of undeniable fact, that all [Borowczyk's] films fundamentally represent the viewpoint of a middle-aged heterosexual man. You can certainly defend them against charges of misogyny by pointing out that the female characters in his later films are generally far stronger-willed and far more in control of their sexual pleasure than was the norm in 1970s cinema, something that became especially clear when [Borowczyk] began a decade-plus collaboration with the Italian actress Marina Pierro. For Redeemer magazine in 1993, Peter Tombs wrote, Marina Pierro is an extraordinary actress who combines a sullen sensuality with an ethereal, almost nervous intensity.

Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (UK: /ˈwʊlstənkrɑːft/; née Godwin; 30 August 1797 – 1 February 1851) was an English novelist who wrote the Gothic novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818), which is considered an early example of science fiction. She also edited and promoted the works of her husband, the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin and her mother was the philosopher and feminist activist Mary Wollstonecraft. Shelley's mother died less than a month after giving birth to her. She was raised by her father, who provided her with a rich if informal education, encouraging her to adhere to his own anarchist political theories. When she was four, her father married a neighbour, Mary Jane Clairmont, with whom Shelley came to have a troubled relationship. In 1814, Shelley began a romance with one of her father's political followers, Percy Bysshe Shelley, who was already married. Together with her stepsister, Claire Clairmont, she and Percy left for France and travelled through Europe. Upon their return to England, Shelley was pregnant with Percy's child. Over the next two years, she and Percy faced ostracism, constant debt and the death of their prematurely born daughter. They married in late 1816, after the suicide of Percy Shelley's first wife, Harriet. In 1816, the couple and Mary's stepsister famously spent a summer with Lord Byron and John William Polidori near Geneva, Switzerland, where Shelley conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, most likely caused by the brain tumour which killed her at age 53. Until the 1970s, Shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish her husband's works and for her novel Frankenstein, which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations. Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Shelley's achievements. Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826) and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829–1846), support the growing view that Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.

Bush, met with Coughlin and expressed sympathy with her and promised a full investigation. Coughlin met with Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney—who told her he had just fired the Secretary of the Navy, implying it was her fault. She resigned from the Navy in February 1994, after being subject to abuse in retaliation for her allegations. She settled out of court with the Tailhook Association in October 1994, and was awarded $5.3 million in damages from the hotel after a jury concluded that the Las Vegas Hilton hotel had been negligent in not providing adequate security at the Tailhook convention. A May 1995 made-for-television movie broadcast on ABC was based on Coughlin's story, though she was not involved in making it. In 2012, Coughlin was speaking for , a nonprofit civil rights organization that supports victims of sexual assault in the United States military.

Sheila Varian (August 8, 1937 – March 6, 2016) was a breeder of Arabian horses who lived and worked at the Varian Arabians Ranch near Arroyo Grande, California. She grew up with a strong interest in horses, and was mentored in horsemanship by Mary "Sid" Spencer, a local rancher and Morgan horse breeder who also introduced Varian to the vaquero or "Californio" tradition of western riding. She started her horse ranch, Varian Arabians, in 1954 with the assistance of her parents. Raising and training horses was her full-time occupation beginning in 1963. She used vaquero-influenced methods of training horses, although she adapted her technique over the years to fit the character of the Arabian horse, which she viewed as a horse breed requiring a smart yet gentle approach. Varian produced a number of influential Arabian horses whose bloodlines are found in a significant number of winning Arabian show horses in the United States. She began her breeding program with a small number of mares whom she bred to her national champion stallion, Bay Abi. She then acquired three mares from Arabian farms in Poland at a time when that nation was still behind the Iron Curtain and importation of horses to the United States was very difficult. These mares and Bay Abi formed her foundation bloodstock. As of 2016, the Varian horses at stud represent the sixth generation of her stallion breeding line, and her foundation mare lines have produced nine generations of offspring. For her accomplishments, Varian received recognition from the United States Equestrian Federation, as well as several awards from various organizations within the Arabian horse industry. For her contributions as breeder and as a horse trainer in the vaquero tradition, she was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in 2003. After she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013, she sought to place the 230-acre Varian Ranch into a conservation easement to protect the land from development, and in 2015 announced that the California Rangeland Trust would partner with her to purchase the development rights and to allow her long-time ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, to operate the horse breeding program after Varian. After Alvarez, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement running with the land, and the Trust would try to find a buyer that would maintain the Arabian horse breeding program as well. Varian died on March 6, 2016, at age 78.

Sylvia Olayinka Walmina Oreshola Blyden (born 1 October 1971 in Freetown, Sierra Leone) is a Sierra Leonean journalist, political commentator, newspaper publisher, and former Sierra Leone minister of Social Welfare, Gender and Children Affairs under erstwhile President Ernest Bai-Koroma from 2016 to 2017. She served as Special Executive Assistant to Sierra Leone's former president Ernest Bai Koroma from 2013 to 2015. Blyden is the founder, CEO, and publisher of Sierra Leonean newspaper Awerness Times. She is the only female news publisher in Sierra Leone, and "one of the most recognisable names in the country." She has spoken of her interest to eventually run for the presidency of Sierra Leone. Born and raised in the capital Freetown, into a prominent political family, Blyden is widely considered one of the most powerful and highly influential female political figures in Sierra Leone. She was a close ally of Sierra Leone's former president Ernest Bai Koroma, and a prominent supporter and public defender of Koroma's presidency. But sadly despicable, former president Ernest Bai-Koroma and his ventriloquist puppets in the APC continue to show ingratitude to her for all that she did to publicly defend the legacy of former President Koroma. Blyden is a Christian and a member of the Creole ethnic group. Blyden is the great-great-granddaughter of Edward Wilmot Blyden, the "father of Pan-Africanism". Her maternal grandfather is a Sierra Leonean politician Solomon A. J. Pratt, and her paternal grandfather is the late Sierra Leonean diplomat Edward Wilmot Blyden III. Political Advocacy. Dr. Sylvia Olayinka Blyden was on May 1, 2020, arrested by the paramilitary dictatorship of current president Julius Maada Bio of Sierra Leone's People Party and charged for seditious libel for untiring advocacy in exposing the excesses of the government that have subjected Sierra Leoneans to unbearable cost of living. She was arrested and placed behind bars for 21 days without any charges - violating her constitutional rights. After 21 days in jail, the government of retired brigadier general and former junta leader, Julius Maada Bio, brought down trumped-up and cooked charges against newspaper publisher and social justice bulwark, Dr. Sylvia Olayinka Blyden. Whilst at the court, she was refused a bill through the influence of President Bio and his SLPP which caused a total of 51 days behind rusty bars. After six months of hearing into the case in court, the cooked charges against Dr. Blyden was thrown out of court on November 18, 2020, because of no proof to justify the government's flimsy charges against her. After the election that brought President Bio to the helm of power, she was one of the few who challenged the results of the election by filing a petition before the high court of Sierra Leone praying the court to nullify the election of President Bio for the re-conduct of fresh election as the 2018 March election was fraudulent. After two years and a half since her petition was filed, the court finally started a hearing into her case in January 2021. During the hearing into the case in the hallowed chambers of the Supreme Court, Dr. Blyden, as the first respondent, represented herself without a lawyer and profoundly and eloquently presented her arguments on why the high court should nullify the election that brought Julius Maada Bio to the nation's presidency. During such presentation, lawyers and non-lawyers in the chambers of the high court nulled their heads in thunderous applause and thrill by the eloquent display of extreme brilliance by Dr. Sylvia Olayinka Blyden in the hallowed chambers of Sierra Leone's high court. But after months of deliberations from both parties, the high court couldn't grant the request of Dr. Blyden to invalidate the election of President Bio.

A sequel to DiMartino and Konietzko's previous series Avatar: The Last Airbender, which aired from 2005 to 2008, the series is animated in a style strongly influenced by anime.

As with its predecessor, the series is set in a fictional universe in which certain people can manipulate, or "bend", one of the four elements: water, earth, fire, or air. Only one individual, the "Avatar", can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world.

The Yale Alley Cats are an all-male, undergraduate a cappella singing group at Yale University. Founded in 1943, they are the third-oldest underclassman a cappella group at Yale. In the summer of 1943, four Yale undergraduate students climbed Saybrook Tower to serenade the night with Henry Carey's "Sally in Our Alley." Their singing awoke the College Master who quickly yelled at them "Stop it! Your singing sounds like a bunch of screeching alley cats!" The Master then silenced the young gentlemen and sent them to bed, but the performance marked the group's founding and taking the name, "The Yale Alley Cats." While the group’s early repertoire was based primarily in jazz, their current arrangements (all composed by present or former group members) span pop, R&B, Motown, folk, and a variety of other genres. The group has created more than 200 a cappella arrangements. Each year, the Alley Cats hosts a large on-campus performance known as the "Champagne Jamboree," traditionally featuring a female guest soloist and a dance number. The group also performs for public and private audiences throughout the United States. Their performance tours are funded through concert revenue. The Yale Alley Cats have entertained audiences worldwide, performing for many notable figures including Martha Stewart, Jay Leno, Stella McCartney, Tom Brokaw, and President Barack Obama.

Antje Paarlberg née Waagmeester (16 February 1808 – 28 October 1885) is known as the inspiration for the novel "So Big". Chicago area author Edna Ferber used South Holland, Illinois, its pioneers and onion farms as background for her 1924 novel about an ambitious widow in a Midwestern Dutch American farming community. The resilience of Antje Wagemeester Paarlberg, a widowed immigrant and determined pioneer, was allegedly the inspiration for the main character Selina Peake DeJong. On 26 April 1835, Antje Waagmeester married Klaas Paarlberg in their birthplace of Warmenhuizen and settled as farmers in nearby Spanbroek where they would get eight children. In 1847 Klaas and Antje and their seven surviving children set off on a voyage from the Netherlands to America in search of better fortunes on the ship Doggersbank. They felt that the State Church was too liberal and the taxes unfair. The taxes in the Netherlands were high; there was blight in the potato crop, and disease among the cattle. The couple heard about wonderful opportunities in America. They left North Holland, a province of the Netherlands with their seven children, the oldest being seven years old and the youngest three months old. Klaas died of pleurisy during the voyage and was buried at sea. He was 43 years old at the time of his death. Antje Paarlberg continued to America with their children with this single thought in mind, De Heere zal wel zorgen or "the Lord will provide". The ship's captain offered to take Antje Paarlberg and her children back to the Netherlands but she refused to go. The determined 'Widow Paarlberg', as she is referred to in South Holland, persevered even after the youngest child also died. The baby was buried in a small cemetery near Lincoln Park. Antje and her remaining six children settled near other Dutch pioneers 20–30 miles south of Chicago, buying eighty acres of land at seven dollars an acre by Thorn Creek. There she built a log cabin plastered with clay near what would become the village of South Holland, Illinois. Eventually all of her children acquired land in the area and developed farms. Antje Paarlberg died of a stroke in October 1885 at the age of 77. Ferber highly fictionalized Antje's life and the Paarlberg family believes that she is somewhat misrepresented in "So Big". South Holland's Dutch descendants take exception to the literary license Ferber took with the character of the widow, creating a pushy flirtatious personality that South Hollanders say was nothing like the real Widow Paarlberg. Ferber gives a nod to the real Antje Paarlberg who appears in the novel as the "Widow Parlenberg". Ferber's So Big won the Pulitzer Prize and is considered among her most popular works. The book Lest We Forget by Henry Paarlberg, one of Klass's and Antje's grandchildren, tells the family's version of the Paarlberg family's difficult journey.

Falkenstein was one of America's most experimental and productive twentieth-century artists.

Though she was respected among the burgeoning post–World War II art scene in Europe and the United States, her disregard for the commodification of art coupled with her peripatetic movement from one art metropolis to another made her an elusive figure. Falkenstein first worked in the San Francisco Bay Area, then in Paris and New York, and finally in Los Angeles. She was involved with art groups as radical as the Gutai Group in Japan and art autre in Paris and secured a lasting position in the vanguard, which she held until her death in 1997. An interest in Einstein's theories of the universe inspired Falkenstein to create sculptures from wire and fused glass that explored the concept of infinite space. Falkenstein's current reputation rests on her sculpture, and her work in three dimensions was often radical and ahead of her time.

She performed the song "Stop - mens legen er go'" ("Stop, While the Going's Good"), and to her surprise, emerged the clear winner. Ulla Pia stated in a recent interview that she had assumed that one of her better-known competitors (such as Dario Campeotto or Gustav Winckler) would win, and her victory came as a shock to her. Ulla Pia went forward to the eleventh Eurovision Song Contest, held on 5 March in Luxembourg City, where "Stop – mens legen er go'" could manage only 14th place of the 18 entries, despite an engaging performance in which Ulla Pia was joined on stage, unusually for the time, by two dancers. It would prove to be Denmark's last Eurovision appearance for over a decade, as broadcaster DR withdrew from the competition in 1967, and would not return until 1978. In the years following her Eurovision appearance, Ulla Pia went on to release several popular singles in Denmark, notably "Karina" and the topical "Flower Power Tøj". She toured regularly into the 1970s, but towards the end of the decade increasing family commitments, combined with a period of ill-health, caused her to retire from show business.

Anna Catharina Zenger (c. 1704–1751) was an American publisher and the first woman to publish a newspaper in America. Her family having fled the Pfalz region of Germany, she was born Anna Catharina Maul around 1704, possibly in England or in the Netherlands. Her family moved through Rotterdam to England and on to New York City in 1710, where she grew up, eventually marrying a member of the same refugee group, John Peter Zenger. The couple married on 11 September 1722 in Manhattan's Dutch Reformed Church. Her husband had worked for New York printer William Bradford, advancing from an indentured servant, to a journeyman, and eventually becoming Bradford's partner in 1725. After publishing an unremarkable Dutch language book about the reformed church, the partnership dissolved and John established his own printing business. John specialized in Dutch religious and academic texts until, in 1732, he was caught up in a political scandal. That year William Cosby became the colony's new governor, and, in responsive to his perceived capriciousness, an opposition party was formed and Zenger was hired to publish their tracts and pamphlets. As their conflict with the governor intensified, the opposition founded a newspaper, the New-York Weekly Journal, with John Zenger as the editor, publisher and printer. (In actuality, Zenger was only responsible for printing; the influential lawyer James Alexander was responsible for the paper's tone and content.) In 1734, Cosby retaliated against the paper, ordering four issues to be burned in public, and John Zenger was arrested for seditious libel. John Zenger, unable to meet bail requirements, ultimately spent more than eight months imprisoned, and during this time Anna Catharina took over his publishing duties. Her level of control over the newspaper during this time is unclear. She is known to have regularly visited her husband in jail and took instructions from him regarding the publication. Author Kent Cooper proposed that, during John's imprisonment, Anna Catharina had editorial control and wrote articles for the paper, but other historians believe that the paper's content was provided by well-educated opposition members. On John's release in 1735, he resumed control of the paper and printing business. Eleven years later, after her husband's death, Anna Catharina once again took responsibility for running both operations. She continued to publish the paper weekly, including a modest section of advertisements, along with other publications, including an annual almanac, and the printing shop also sold books and stationery. In 1748 she gave control of the printing business to her stepson, John Zenger, Jr., and moved to a rural area outside of the city where she opened a small bookstore. She died in 1751.

Ellen J. Tronnier (June 28, 1927 – May 21, 2015) was an outfielder who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5'6" (1.71 m), 135 lb. (61 k), she batted and threw right handed. The AAGPBL emerged in the spring of 1943, being formed as a non-profit organization as an initiative of Philip K. Wrigley, chewing gum magnate and owner of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club. Wrigley conceived the idea as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the World War II military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players. By sending out scouts and setting up tryouts in dozens of major cities, Wrigley attracted hundreds of girls from all over America and Canada who were eager to play in this new professional league. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final tryouts at Wrigley Field in Chicago where 60 were chosen to become the first girls to ever play professional baseball. Born in Cudahy, Wisconsin, Ellen Tronnier joined the league when she was only 16 years old, after surviving two exhausting tryouts. The first was held locally at Borchert Field, where only 16 ladies were chosen to go on to in Chicago for the decisive tryout. Tronnier was one of the lucky ones and was assigned to the South Bend Blue Sox. After one season, Tronnier decided to return to school and enrolled in the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse. Upon completion of her degree, she taught physical education in the Milwaukee Public Schools during 33 years, working at South Division High School and Sholes Middle School. Besides, Tronnier played softball for a long time, competing in several tournaments as an accomplished women's fast pitch softball player for nearly 27 years. During this period, her teams won league, state and regional championships and, in 1956, her club won the National Invitational Tournament. Then, during the 1970s she opened a baseball school for girls as part of the Milwaukee Recreation Department. The AABPBL folded after the 1954 season. Twenty-six years later, June Peppas, a former star pitcher in the league, began assembling a list of names and addresses of former AAGPBL players and worked into a newsletter that resulted in the AAGPBL's first-ever reunion at Chicago's Wrigley Field in 1982. Starting from that reunion, a Players Association was formed in 1986 and many former AAGPBL players continued to enjoy reunions, which became annual events in 1988. Tronnier attended the reunions and regained communication with her teammates and old friends. Of the approximately 560 ladies who had played in the league, most had lost touch with the others, at least not until the reunion held in Chicago. Through the organization of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum opened in 1988 an AAGPBL permanent display at Cooperstown, New York, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personalities. Tronnier, along with the rest of the league's girls, is now enshrined in the Hall. It was inspiration enough for the 1992 film A League of Their Own, directed by Penny Marshall and starred by Geena Davis, Tom Hanks and Madonna, where was depicted what these pioneering girls endured. Tronnier gained induction into the Wisconsin Amateur Softball Association Hall of Fame in 1990. She remained active after retirement, advising young people while signing baseball cards and talking about her playing days. Ellen Tronnier died in 2015 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the age of 87. She was interred at Arlington Park Cemetery in Greenfield, Wisconsin.

Jane Marum Roush (born September 24, 1956) is a Virginia lawyer and Judge who served as an interim Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia from 2015 to 2016. On July 27, 2015, Governor Terry McAuliffe announced his appointment of Roush to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice LeRoy F. Millette Jr. effective July 31, 2015. Under the Constitution of Virginia, this original interim appointment was to expire thirty days after the commencement of the next session of the Virginia General Assembly, unless the legislature elected her to a full twelve-year term. On August 17, 2015, the General Assembly convened in special session but failed to elect anyone to the full twelve-year term before the Senate of Virginia purported to adjourn sine die. The Constitution prohibits one chamber of the legislature from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber. The Governor claimed that this provision applied only to regular sessions of the General Assembly; the House of Delegates and most Senate Republicans claimed it applied to special sessions as well, and that the Senate's adjournment was invalid because the House did not consent. Because there was legal uncertainty about whether the legislature was still in session, it was unclear whether the governor could fill the vacancy created when Justice Roush's original interim appointment expired on September 16, 2015. Nevertheless, the governor announced his view that the legislature was not in session and purported to reappoint her for a second interim term. Whether this second interim appointment was valid or invalid has not been determined. If valid, the second interim appointment expired on February 12, 2016, thirty days after the regular session of the General Assembly began on January 13, because the legislature did not elect her to a full twelve-year term. On March 2, 2016, the Senate nominated Roush to a full, twelve-year term, beginning March 1, 2016. The House rejected the nomination by a 38-55 vote. Later that month, the General Assembly elected then-Judge Stephen R. McCullough to fill the seat for a full term.

She and her family were expelled from Egypt in 1957 during the period of nationalization under President Gamal Abdel Nasser. The family immigrated to Israel where Jacques lived on a kibbutz for three years. In 1961, Jacques and her family left Israel for France. Jacques' novels focus exclusively on the Jews of Egypt, mainly during the 1940s and 1950s. Her novels can be described as reflecting the postcolonial condition. In the novels, both Egyptian Jews and Muslims interact in day-to-day activity. In a few novels, like Gilda Stambouli souffre et se plaint (2002)and Un Baiser froid comme la lune (1983), Jacques takes her characters from Egypt to France and Israel where they face issues of acculturation. The characters' relationship to French language and culture is problematized and so is their relationship to Israel. Jacques's characters confront hostility, humiliation, conflicted ideologies, political instability, and cultural alienation. The novels explore the conditions under which Jews lived in Egypt in the years and days before their peremptory expulsion; the most developed cases are Lumière de l'oeil, L'Héritage de la tante Carlotta, Les Femmes avec leur amour, and the tragic La Descente au paradis. In her novels, Jacques describes the suffering and humiliation experienced by both Jews and Muslims and shows both perspectives. Alongside her novelistic production, Jacques has been involved in French theater, radio, and the press. Jacques is the winner of the Prix Femina, 1991, for Deborah et les anges dissipés.

Seaxburh, also Saint Sexburga of Ely (died about 699) was a Queen as well as an abbess, and is a saint of the Christian Church. She was married to King Eorcenberht of Kent. After her husband's death in 664, Seaxburh remained in Kent to bring up her children. She acted as regent until her young son Ecgberht came of age. Seaxburh founded the abbeys at Milton Regis and Minster-in-Sheppey where her daughter Ermenilda was also a nun. She moved to the double monastery at Ely where her sister Æthelthryth was abbess and succeeded her when Æthelthryth died in 679. According to Bede, in 695, Seaxburh organised the movement (or translation) of Æthelthryth's remains to a marble sarcophagus, after they had lain for sixteen years in a common grave. On opening the grave, it was discovered that her body was miraculously preserved. The legend is described in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which celebrates the saintly virtues of Æthelthryth, but speaks less highly of Seaxburh, referring only to her marriage, succession as abbess and translation of her sister's relics. The date of Seaxburh's death at Ely is not known. The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge, compiled after 1106, describe her early life, marriage to Eorcenberht, retirement from secular life and her final years as a nun and abbess at Ely.

She is best known however for her only film role in the Tod Browning, pre-code production Freaks in 1932. Her body was supposedly split down the middle, one side female and the other male. She claimed to be an intersex person ("true hermaphrodite" as it was called her times), but there is no evidence to confirm whether this was the case or not; she may have just been a very skilled impersonator, in the style of Albert Alberta Karas. Like many sideshow "hermaphrodites" of the early 20th century, she presented a "half and half" trick: woman on the left and man on the right. One side of the body would be exercised, have hair trimmed, and tanned; the other side would be covered and un-exercised, making it pale and flabby, so the chest resembled a woman's breast while the hair was grown out. The performer would then wear a split costume: a low-cut, tight top and hotpants on the "female" side and on the "male" side a Tarzan-style loincloth.

Margaret Humphreys, CBE, AO (born 1944) is a British social worker and author from Nottingham, England. She worked for Nottinghamshire County Council operating around Radford, Nottingham and Hyson Green in child protection and adoption services. In 1986 she received a letter from a woman in Australia who, believing she was an orphan, was looking to locate her birth certificate so she could get married. In 1987, she investigated and brought to public attention the British government programme of Home Children. This involved forcibly relocating poor British children to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the former Rhodesia and other parts of the Commonwealth of Nations, often without their parents' knowledge. Children were often told their parents had died, and parents were told their children had been placed for adoption elsewhere in the UK. According to Humphreys, up to 150,000 children are believed to have been resettled under the scheme, some as young as three, about 7,000 of whom were sent to Australia. Saving money was one of the motives behind this policy. The children were allegedly deported because it was cheaper to care for them overseas. It cost an estimated £5 per day to keep a child on welfare in a British institution, but only 10% of that, ten shillings, in an Australian one.

Carrie Moore (31 July 1882 – 5 September 1956) was an Australian actress who achieved fame on the Australian and British stage. She was born Caroline Ellen Moore in Geelong, Victoria, on 31 July 1882, the third of the nine children of Robert William Moore, a labourer and Mary née Wyatt. She first appeared on stage in Geelong in local amateur productions. By late 1895, she had successfully auditioned for J. C. Williamson and was appearing in the Christmas pantomime, Djin Djin, attracting positive reviews. After successfully understudying in 1897 and 1898, Moore performed for Williamson's "Royal Comic Opera Company" in a number of leading roles. In a highly publicized case she took Ernest Tyson to court alleging "breach of promise", in August 1901. The matter was settled out of court. In July 1903 she left Australia for England, where she appeared for producer George Edwardes. For five years she performed on the London stage and in provincial theatre, becoming "a much-paragraphed and much-photographed actress." In mid 1908 she returned to Australia, to perform the role of Sonia in The Merry Widow for Williamson, a role that brought her great acclaim. She married Englishman Percy Bigwood in September, the event attracting much press attention in part because of another action for "breach of promise", this time brought against Bigwood by a Miss Silva. The marriage also proved to be bigamous – on the couple's return to England it transpired Bigwood already had a wife and child, as a 1912 divorce action showed. On her return to England, she appeared in A Persian Princess (1909) and on stage for producer Robert Courtneidge. She made several return trips to perform in Australia, in 1912 and 1917. Moore was estranged from Bigwood by the time of his death from pneumonia in 1915. She married wealthy Sydney bookmaker John Wyatt in 1918 and retired from the stage. She obtained a divorce from Wyatt in 1932 and returned to a few supporting roles on stage, including Music in the Air and a Command Performance in London in 1938. In 1945 she appeared in her only film, a supporting role in Charles Chauvel's Sons of Matthew. She died in relative poverty and obscurity in Sydney, in 1956.

At 4:43 p.m. on August 12, 2013, Tiffany Daniels (born March 11, 1988) left her job as a theater technician at Pensacola State College in Pensacola, Florida, United States, telling her supervisor that she would not be returning for a few days but did not say why. Although she returned home briefly afterwards, Daniels's housemate was busy with a telephone conversation and did not see her. She has not been seen since. Because she had told her supervisor she would be taking time off, Daniels was not reported missing until the end of the week, after she had failed to return to work. Her friends and family were unaware of any plans she might have made that would explain her absence. Daniels's housemate also reported that she had left unusually early for work that day after some strange activity even earlier that morning. A security camera on the Pensacola Beach Bridge connecting Gulf Breeze and Santa Rosa islands recorded her car crossing the bridge almost three hours after she had left work. Eight days after her disappearance, the vehicle was found at a parking lot in Pensacola Beach, along with her bicycle, purse and cell phone. Residents in the area said the car had only been there a few days, and reported seeing an unidentified male around it. Two unidentified fingerprints were found on the car, but a search of the surrounding beach area found no trace of Daniels. Several theories have been put forth to account for Daniels's disappearance, ranging from foul play to an accidental drowning. Based on an anonymous tip and several reported sightings further west along Interstate 10, Daniels's family believes she was a victim of human trafficking and may still be alive. The case was the subject of a 2016 episode of Investigation Discovery's Disappeared.
